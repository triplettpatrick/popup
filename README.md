# Popup Form Submission Confirmation

This is a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that displays a popup confirmation message after a form submission. When the user clicks on the submit button, a popup appears with a message thanking the user for submitting the form. The popup also contains an image of a green checkmark, indicating that the form submission was successful.

# Usage
To use this code, simply copy the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code into your project. Make sure to include the image file "checkmark.png" in the "images" folder.

# How It Works
The code uses JavaScript to add and remove a CSS class to the popup element. When the user clicks on the submit button, the addPopup() function is called, which adds the "add-popup" class to the popup element. This class contains the CSS rules that display the popup.

When the user clicks on the "OK" button in the popup, the removePopup() function is called, which removes the "add-popup" class from the popup element. This hides the popup from the user.
